    ── PROCUREMENT phase ────────────────────────────────────────────
    SUPPLY_SABOTAGE
        payload: {"component": str, "loss_fraction": float}
        Effect: that fraction of arriving units moved to scrap bucket.

    PRICE_INFLATION
        payload: {"component": str, "cost_multiplier": float}
        Effect: transport + material cost multiplied for that component.

    PRIORITY_SUPPLY
        payload: {"component": str, "mean_bonus": float}
        Effect: quality_mean for that component raised by bonus.

    SUBSIDISED_INPUTS
        payload: {"component": str, "cost_multiplier": float}  (<1.0)
        Effect: procurement cost for that component reduced.

    ── PRODUCTION phase ─────────────────────────────────────────────
    MACHINE_SABOTAGE
        payload: {"component": str, "condition_hit": float}
        Effect: machine condition for that component reduced.

    INFRA_DELAY
        payload: {"component": str}
        Effect: any machine upgrade decision for that component
                is ignored this cycle.

    FAST_TRACK_INFRA
        payload: {"component": str,
                  "condition_bonus": float, "quality_bonus": float}
        Effect: if a new machine is bought this cycle for that component,
                starting condition and grade are boosted.

    LABOUR_STRIKE
        payload: {}
        Effect: production_survival set to STRIKE_SURVIVAL (0.5).

    LABOUR_POACH
        payload: {"skill_hit": float}

    RND_SABOTAGE
        payload: {"component": str, "focus": str, "levels_stolen": int}
        Effect: rnd level for that component+focus reduced.

    SKILLED_LABOUR
        payload: {"skill_bonus": float}
        Effect: team's skill_level increased.

    RND_INVESTMENT
        payload: {"component": str, "focus": str, "level_arriving": int}
        Effect: rnd level incremented when this event is consumed.
                Created by the team's production decision; scheduled
                for the cycle when it matures.

    ── SALES phase ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
    MARKET_LIMIT
        payload: {"block_fraction": float}
        Effect: that fraction of sellable drones blocked from market.

    DEMAND_SUPPRESSION

        Effect: effective sell price capped at PRICE_SUBSTANDARD.

    DEMAND_BOOST
        payload: {"demand_multiplier": float}  (>1.0)
        Effect: team's brand_demand_weight multiplied.

    GOV_PURCHASE
        payload: {"units": int, "price_per_unit": float}
        Effect: government buys this many drones at guaranteed price,
                added to revenue before market allocation.

    QUALITY_WAIVER
        payload: {"threshold_reduction": float}
        Effect: effective qr_hard lowered by this amount for this cycle.

        Effect: team skips any audit triggered this cycle.

    ── FINANCIAL phase (end of sales) ───────────────────────────────
    LOAN_INTEREST
        payload: {"amount": float, "lender_team_id": int|null}
        Effect: amount deducted from borrower; if lender_team_id is
